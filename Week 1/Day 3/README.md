Reflect:
1. What is the best thing about this class for you thus far?
The best this thing for me is learning and doing things that I can use in the future
2. What would happen if you made an <h7> tag in a web page?
It will look very small
3. How would you describe an html page to a middle school kid?
I would say it's structure of an essay
