Reflect:
This class will be a challenge, helpful and fun (I hope).
My learning style will be tested, it depends on how much work and practice I do.
Review:
git status I think it gives you the status of the open file
git add I think it has to do with adding to file or document
git commit, allows you to keep track of your action
cd allows you to open documents
ls is list
mkdir makes a new folder
touch I don't remember
