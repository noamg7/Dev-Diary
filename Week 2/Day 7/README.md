Reflect:
1. what was the most frustrating thing about today?
I can't think of anything frustrating, I found it all to be challenging and helpful.
2. Why do you thing that good code conventions are in place?
In order for tasks to get done properly and on time.
3. How would you describe the box mode to someone that has never seen a computer?
I would describe it as a math professor and teacher describe the area of a square.
Review:
1. list all of the errors that you found today.
Spelling, silly mistakes placing a ; instead of : etc., lack of organized structures in the codes.
2. How would you make sure that you do not suffer through what we did today?
The best thing to do is when writing the codes, type them in an organized manner to make it simple to follow.
3. What is padding?
It is the space between the text and the border.
4. What is margin?
the space between the borders
5. What does the following do?
