Reflect:
1. Could you make a simple website utilizing what we have learned thus far? Why? or Why not?
No. Because it will not appear professional.
2. What do you feel is most difficult to understand about git and the git workflow?
The main challenge for me is that it does not have to have a particular order, and I don't see the how the git commit -m works.
3. what is the most interesting thing that you have learned thus far?
Everything!!! I love coding.
Review:
1. Describe the git workflow up to this point. Be specific about the order and the reason.
git init, git add letting you know what you are saving. git commit -m lets you name what you have saved. git touch create a document ex. README.md.
2. What is the difference between <ul> and <ol>?
ul is unordered list meaning you will see dots. <ol> is ordered list you will see 1, 2, 3, etc.
3. what does the <a> allow you to do with a webpage?
<a> allows you to like to a website. For example google.com
