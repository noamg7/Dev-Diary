Reflect:
1.What else would you like to be able to do when creating your web application?
present images as links to other websites.
2.How do you think you are going to keep the different languages JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
straight?
By using them over and over again, until one day my brain will go "JavaScript type this."
Review:
1.How would you select a paragraph and make the text color "light salmon"?
<p style="color:light salmon" or text-color:light salmon>
2.What is the difference between inline and internal style?
inline styles are "BAD" style=":;"
internal styles {
  ;
}  
3.what will the following CSS styling do
h1{
  font-family:comit sans ms";background-color:chartreuse;
}
it establishes the color of the font bing comit sans ms and style font font-family
chartreuse will be the background-color of the heading
