Reflect:
1. You have learned three different languages up until this point, which one is the easiest to you, HTML or Java Script? Why?
HTML. Because HTML is more simply constructed, it is the content of the page. Java Script is how will the page look and function. The behind the scenes that people don't know about.
2. We have just touch HTML, CSS and Java Script, What was the most difficult concept of those three things to you?
Java Script.
3. What is a site that could build your skills up until this point?
W3Schools, Google.com, and Youtube.
Review:
1. I need to grab a button, with the id 'clicky' and the classes 'btnbtn-default', to change the styling when the button is clicked. Which one of the JavaScript sector function would you use?
I am lost, I don't know!!!!
2. What are some of the events that you can 'listen' for and respond to with DOM elements?
I am lost, I don't know!!!!
3. What is provided to you when you use the getElementByld? How is it different than to getElementByClass?
it connects to the elements that have an Id. The difference is that you are not looking for a Class, but something more specific.
