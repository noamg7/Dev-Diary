Reflect:
1. This class can be difficult at times, how does it compare to the things
that you have done before?
It is different from what I have done before because I never had to create a page online that I had to work on.
2. We all have our own ideas and ways that we prefer to accomplish tasks, how
do you think that people would fair if the class was run the way you prefer?
I don't know, I am different from everyone else, my mind works in steps. You follow the steps until you solve the problem or complete your objective.
Review:
1. Add a mouseenter event handler to every anchor tag on the page that changes the text size.
create a variable named mouseenter command it to go through the document get the element by tagName
function to change the font size
get log and go crazy.
2. Add a user login page to your website so that people only see the pages
you want them to see.
create a div within it have a label and an input with an id class and one more thing I can't think about right this second.
3. Position an image in the center of the page.
one of the way is to command the div to be text-align center, or play with the margin.
